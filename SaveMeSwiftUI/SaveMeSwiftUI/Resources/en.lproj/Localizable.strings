"about_body" = "My name is Jakub and I am the creator of the SaveMe application. This is a project that I found necessary, as many people ask themselves: \"Why do I feel like that?\", \"What can I do with it?\" - they try to understand themselves, which is very difficult. It started from the moment when I was looking for an application for myself that would be free and at the same time contain everything I needed. I know programmers need to earn money, but I hate subscribing - I think I'd rather pay once, more than for subscription, and make sure I don't have to worry about taking money from my account at an inopportune moment.

This application is not a replacement for professional help - let it be an electronic diary that may help you. I am not legally responsible for improper use of the application and any damage that someone may cause to himself or others. SaveMe is not a medical application - in case of mental disorders, visit a specialist who is a wonderful person and will try to help. You can also call the helpline where you can also find help.

Good luck and enjoy using the app!";
